# wanpol
A code for Wannier polarizability method

Wannier polarizability method is a way to calculate the polarizability based on the spatial extension of the Wannier functions in a system. In this method, the time-consuming calculation of polarizability through the calculation of dipole derivatives can be entirely bypassed. It can then be combined with ab initio molecular dyanics simulations to compute the finite-temperature Raman spectra.
