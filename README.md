A code for Wannier polarizability method

Wannier polarizability method is a way to calculate the polarizability based on the spatial extension of the Wannier functions in a system. In this method, the time-consuming calculation of polarizability through the calculation of dipole derivatives can be entirely bypassed. It can then be combined with ab initio molecular dyanics simulations to compute the finite-temperature Raman spectra. The method is based on the following two papers:

1. 'Efficient “On‐the‐Fly” calculation of Raman Spectra from Ab‐Initio molecular dynamics: Application to hydrophobic/hydrophilic solutes in bulk water', P. Partovi‐Azar, T.D. Kühne, Journal of Computational Chemistry 36, 2188 (2015).
2. 'Evidence for the existence of Li_2S_2 clusters in lithium–sulfur batteries: ab initio Raman spectroscopy simulation', P. Partovi-Azar, T.D. Kühne, P. Kaghazchi, Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics 17, 22009 (2015).
